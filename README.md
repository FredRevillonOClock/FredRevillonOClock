# Hi, I'm Fred

 I'm from Paris (France). I'm an "old" junior developer. 
 I'm actually studying at the O'Clock School. 
 Before that, I worked as  location manager and film producer (cinema, Tv, advertising...).
 I got also some experiences as director, writer, editor... 
 For me, it was time to change my life and start a new professional career.
